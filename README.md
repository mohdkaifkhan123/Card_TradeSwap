About

The platform is a web-based application built using modern web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The backend is developed using a scalable framework like Node.js with Express.js, and the data is stored in a NoSQL database like MongoDB.
User authentication and account creation are implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user sessions. Upon account creation, users are assigned a unique identifier and can start collecting digital cards immediately.
The card collection feature is implemented using a relational database schema to store card metadata such as name, description, rarity, and image URL. When users open packs, the backend randomly selects three cards of varying rarity from the database and delivers them to the user interface.
The trading system is implemented using RESTful APIs, allowing users to propose, accept, and reject trades with other users. Each trade request is represented as a JSON object containing the sender's and receiver's user IDs, as well as the IDs of the cards being traded. The backend verifies the validity of the trade and updates the card ownership accordingly.
The search system allows users to find other players based on various criteria such as username, card collection, or trade history. This feature is implemented using efficient database queries and pagination to handle large datasets.
Overall, the platform provides a seamless and interactive experience for users to collect and trade digital cards while leveraging modern web technologies and best practices in software development.
